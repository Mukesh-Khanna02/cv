    The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential
    qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, natura
    is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the
    intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own
    accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
    original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers
    (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency
    ever since. During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the
    passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly
    became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by
    some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history
    (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time,
    especially after Charles Darwin.[1]</p>
